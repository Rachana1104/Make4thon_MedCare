        You have answered this anxiety screening in such a way as to suggest
        that you are not likely currently suffering from an anxiety disorder.
        Remember that a little anxiety in normal, everyday life is to be
        expected and is a good thing. Nobody should be without any anxiety
        whatsoever, as anxiety is our body's way of telling us that we should
        pay closer attention to a situation, event or person in our lives (even
        if that person is ourselves). Scoring in this range suggests you have
        that normal level of anxiety but would not likely qualify for an anxiety
        disorder diagnosis.
